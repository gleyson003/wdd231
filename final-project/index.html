            Belém is the capital and most populous city in the state of Pará. 
            It is located in Guajará Bay, in the northern portion of Pará territory, in an area characterized by high humidity. 
            The city was founded by Portuguese colonizers, who, given its local geostrategic importance, built military installations in Belém territory.
            Belém's great economic boom occurred during the rubber cycle, in which the city played an important role as a commercial warehouse. 
            Currently, the local economy is anchored in the tertiary sector. The city's government is structured into a division of the Three Powers.
